New service requests in the past 24 hours: 152 reports were filed, including 47 Dumped Items, 31 Graffiti reports, 46 E‑Scooter issues, 5 Light problems, and several others such as Sidewalk Repair (2), Park Maintenance (2) and Tree Maintenance (3).

The quickest turn‑around was seen for Dead Animal Pickup – average response time was just 0.45 hours (about 27 minutes). Animal Services also performed well, with an average response of roughly 4 hours.

Graffiti and E‑Scooter calls continue to dominate the volume, making up two‑thirds of yesterday’s new reports. While many cases are still “In Progress,” the city’s crews are keeping response times short for the highest‑risk issues.
