Over the past 90 days the city logged 6,648 dumped‑item reports, but they took the longest to resolve – an average of about 352 hours (roughly 15 days). Graffiti was the next most common issue with 3,561 calls and an average response of 160 hours (about 7 days). Tree maintenance had 859 reports and was addressed in about 71 hours (just under 3 days).  

Animal services and dead‑animal pickups were handled much faster: 247 animal‑service calls averaged 19 hours and 437 dead‑animal pickups averaged 16 hours.  

A few categories still see longer waits. Illegal firework reports (37 calls) took an average of 226 hours (≈9 days) and Marina repair (8 calls) averaged 257 hours (≈11 days).  

Citizens can help speed up service by reporting issues directly through the Go Long Beach app.
