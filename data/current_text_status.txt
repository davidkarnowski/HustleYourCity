City service response update – 24‑hour snapshot

In the past day Long Beach logged 47 new graffiti reports, 50 dumped‑item calls, and a handful of new tree‑maintenance, light, traffic‑signal and animal‑service requests. Average response times for these newly logged cases are still being recorded, but early data show very quick handling for animal services (≈0.5 hour) and dead‑animal pickups (≈1.2 hours).

Looking at the last 7 days, response times have improved noticeably:

* Graffiti – average 26.8 hours, down from a 30‑day average of 70 hours.  
* Tree maintenance – average 3.8 hours, one of the fastest turnarounds.  
* Traffic signals – average 1.85 hours.  
* Street repair – average 11.2 hours.  

These figures suggest the city is accelerating its response to high‑volume issues while keeping specialized services swift.

Citizens can continue to report problems and track progress through the Go Long Beach app, helping keep our neighborhoods clean and safe.​
